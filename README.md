# QR-code-generator

I created a QR code generator using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML for the frontend.
Requirements: pip install flask qrcode[pil] 


Starting the app:

1. Make sure your Flask server is running. If it's not, start it (VS Code terminal):

   python app.py

2. Open your web browser and go to

   http://127.0.0.1:5000/

3. Enter a URL in the input field.

4. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.

After clicking the button, the app will generate an image with a QR Code. Scan it and it will get you to the link.
